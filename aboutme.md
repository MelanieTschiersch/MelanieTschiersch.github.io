Hi, my name is Melanie Tschiersch and I am currently a PhD student in the [Braincircuits and Behavior lab](https://braincircuitsbehavior.org/) in Barcelona under the supervision of Albert Compte. I'm currently trying to understand how working memory and serial dependence are distributed across different brain regions and how to eat good food without cooking or spending a lot of money (which is most likely the harder problem). 

### My story

I started my journey towards neuroscience with a bachelor's in medical engineering in LÃ¼beck, Germany, where I learned that the brain is **by far** the most interesting organ (fight me on this). That's why I went on to apply to the Master's in Neuroengineering in Munich, which had the intimidating word Elite Master's attached to it and almost scared me into not applying. However, when I actually got accepted I realized it mostly meant a small group of international and fantastic students, who soon became friends, and some extra research stays and money to cover inviting guest speakers and having a retreat. Through this retreat and a research stay is also how I met my current supervisor and realized I wanted to do a PhD. I then applied to an FPI scholarship in Spain (and some others which I won't mention by name because I got rejected) and moved to Barcelona. And this is the end of my story... for now.
