Hi, my name is Melanie Tschiersch and I am currently a PhD student in the [Braincircuits and Behavior lab](https://braincircuitsbehavior.org/) in Barcelona under the supervision of Albert Compte. I'm currently trying to understand how working memory drifts and serial dependence are distributed across different brain regions. 

### My story

I started my journey towards neuroscience with a bachelor's in medical engineering in LÃ¼beck, Germany, where I learned that the brain is **by far** the most interesting organ (fight me on this). That's why I went on to pursue my master's degree in Neuroengineering in Munich, where I met a small group of international and fantastic students, who soon became friends, got the opportunity to attend some fantastic lectures and join for a spring school and a retreat. Through this retreat and a following research stay is how I met my current supervisor and realized I wanted to do a PhD. I then applied to an FPI scholarship in Spain (and some others which I won't mention by name because I got rejected) and moved to Barcelona, where I am currently trying to understand more about working memory (see above).
