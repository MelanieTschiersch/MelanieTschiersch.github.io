I have been recommended and stumbling upon many websites so far in my PhD (thank you twitter) that promised to make research a breeze. However, most of them first get me all excited and then I never look at them again. Here are the ones that stayed with me:


## 1. [connectedpapers.com](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)

This one is an absolute gem. If you are working on a specific subject and have your favourite research article ligned up, type the title into .[connectedpapers.com](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) and it will build you a graph of papers that are connected to your target paper. It also directly shows you the authors (year) notation in the graph and the similarity to your paper through the distance between the nodes. When you're not yet familiar with one of them, click on the node and it shows you the abstract. This way you can be sure that if you miss a similar paper in your review or introduction, at least most of your favourite authors missed it too (as it builds the graph based on citations)!


## 2. [jane.biosemantics.org](https://jane.biosemantics.org/)

Similar to connectedpapers, .[jane.biosemantics.org](https://jane.biosemantics.org/) can recommend you relevant papers. However, it can also recommend authors as potential reviewers or journals for where to publish your work. This is why instead of searching based on a target paper, you can find articles based on your own title, abstract or keywords. Basically, Jane can give you some great advice!


## 3. Making everything look prettier

For this subsection I have a couple of nice websites so that I think they're better off being in here together: [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) is great for getting nice color maps or finding matching colors to make your figures look pretty (I bet there are others, I just ended up using this). [datavizcatalogue.com](https://datavizcatalogue.com/) is good, if you ever need an overview on which types of graphs are out there and could be useful to you. 
**And finally** (this one would probably deserve an extra section):  [scidraw.io](https://scidraw.io/) is here for you if you need scientific svg files for anything about the brain but don't want to make them yourself. Need a human brain drawing, it's there; a mouse or a fruitfly, of course they have it. Honestly, it's pretty cool, so go check it out!


## 4. [sci-hub](https://sci-hub.se)

Honestly, you probably know this one (that's why it's at the end) but leaving it out just felt wrong. Whenever you want to start a riot because you're so sick of predatory publishers make you pay to publish your work **AND** to access it **AND** won't pay you for review, know that [sci-hub](https://sci-hub.se) (link without guaranty, the address changes often due to its .. uhm .. semi-legal activities) is trying it's best to make a crappy situation better. They have almost all paywalled and non-paywalled papers on there, so just look for the papers of your dreams without getting angry.


These are my favourites for now, but I will update it as I learn more and realize what else makes doing science a bit easier for me.
